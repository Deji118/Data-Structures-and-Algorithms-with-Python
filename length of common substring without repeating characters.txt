Method 2 (Linear Time)
Let us talk about the linear time solution now. This solution uses extra space to store the last indexes of already visited characters. The idea is to scan the string from left to right, keep track of the maximum length Non-Repeating Character Substring (NRCS) seen so far. Let the maximum length be max_len. When we traverse the string, we also keep track of length of the current NRCS using cur_len variable. For every new character, we look for it in already processed part of the string (A temp array called visited[] is used for this purpose). If it is not present, then we increase the cur_len by 1. If present, then there are two cases:

a) The previous instance of character is not part of current NRCS (The NRCS which is under process). In this case, we need to simply increase cur_len by 1.
b) If the previous instance is part of the current NRCS, then our current NRCS changes. It becomes the substring staring from the next character of previous instance to currently scanned character. We also need to compare cur_len and max_len, before changing current NRCS (or changing cur_len).
# Python program to find the length of the longest substring 
# without repeating characters 
NO_OF_CHARS = 256

def longestUniqueSubsttr(string): 
	n = len(string) 
	cur_len = 1	 # To store the lenght of current substring 
	max_len = 1	 # To store the result 
	prev_index = 0 # To store the previous index 
	i = 0

	# Initialize the visited array as -1, -1 is used to indicate 
	# that character has not been visited yet. 
	visited = [-1] * NO_OF_CHARS 

	# Mark first character as visited by storing the index of 
	# first character in visited array. 
	visited[ord(string[0])] = 0

	# Start from the second character. First character is already 
	# processed (cur_len and max_len are initialized as 1, and 
	# visited[str[0]] is set 
	for i in xrange(1,n): 
		prev_index = visited[ord(string[i])] 

		# If the currentt character is not present in the already 
		# processed substring or it is not part of the current NRCS, 
		# then do cur_len++ 
		if prev_index == -1 or (i - cur_len > prev_index): 
			cur_len+=1

		# If the current character is present in currently considered 
		# NRCS, then update NRCS to start from the next character of 
		# previous instance. 
		else: 
			# Also, when we are changing the NRCS, we should also 
			# check whether length of the previous NRCS was greater 
			# than max_len or not. 
			if cur_len > max_len: 
				max_len = cur_len 

			cur_len = i - prev_index 

		# update the index of current character 
		visited[ord(string[i])] = i 

	# Compare the length of last NRCS with max_len and update 
	# max_len if needed 
	if cur_len > max_len: 
		max_len = cur_len 

	return max_len 

# Driver program to test the above function 
string = "ABDEFGABEF"
print "The input string is " + string 
length = longestUniqueSubsttr(string) 
print ("The length of the longest non-repeating character" +
	" substring is " + str(length))
