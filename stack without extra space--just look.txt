# Python code to reverse a string 
# using extended slice syntax 
Explanation : Extended slice offers to put a “step” field as [start,stop,step], and giving no field as start and stop indicates default to 0 and string length respectively and “-1” denotes starting from end and stop at the start, hence reversing string.

# Function to reverse a string 
def reverse(string): 
	string = string[::-1] 
	return string 

s = "Geeksforgeeks"

print ("The original string is : ",end="") 
print (s) 

print ("The reversed string(using extended slice syntax) is : ",end="") 
print (reverse(s)) 


def revers(s): 
	str = "" 
	for i in s: 
		str = i+str
	return str

s = "Geeks"

print ("The original string is : ",end="") 
print (s) 

print ("The reversed string(using loops) is : ",end="") 
print (revers(s))
