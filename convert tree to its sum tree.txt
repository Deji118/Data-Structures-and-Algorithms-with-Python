Convert a given tree to its Sum Tree
Given a Binary Tree where each node has positive and negative values. Convert this to a tree where each node contains the sum of the left and right sub trees in the original tree. The values of leaf nodes are changed to 0.
For example, the following tree
int toSumTree(struct node *node) 
{ 
    // Base case 
    if(node == NULL) 
      return 0; 
  
    // Store the old value 
    int old_val = node->data; 
  
    // Recursively call for left and right subtrees and store the sum as 
    // new value of this node 
    node->data = toSumTree(node->left) + toSumTree(node->right); 
  
    // Return the sum of values of nodes in left and right subtrees and 
    // old_value of this node 
    return node->data + old_val; 
}
